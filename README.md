• Developed an Android application as a University project that simulates a system like Service Ontario
• Connected the system to a Firebase database that keeps track of all of the necessary data for the application to run as intended
• Customer accounts have the ability to order services such as the renewal of a driver's license, whereas branch employee accounts are able to update their branch profiles, offer new services & keep track of the customers' requests
• Administrator accounts can keep track of the available accounts on the system as well as create & delete services
